We are group of developers connected by **Google Developer Challenge Scholarship - Android Developer track**. 
We decided to work together to create great open-sourced app and learn from each other.

## Our goal
As we mentioned our main goal is to learn new thing. That is why we pay a lot of attention to our architecture. 
We use **MVVM** with **Android Architecture Components**, **LiveData**, **Room**. Most of the time we use [google samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components) as our guide.
